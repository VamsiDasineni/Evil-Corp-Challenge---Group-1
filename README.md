Introduction:

The "Evil Corp" challenge is a pwn (exploitation) category challenge in cybersecurity 
competitions. It is designed to assess participants' skills in identifying and exploiting 
vulnerabilities in a simulated environment. Participants are required to find and 
exploit
vulnerabilities within the challenge to gain control or access to specific resources.

Abstract:
Pwn challenges typically involve finding security vulnerabilities in software or 
systems. Participants need to analyze the given scenario, understand the 
vulnerabilities present, and devise an exploit. The goal is to demonstrate the ability 
to think like a hacker and exploit weaknesses for educational purposes. The "Evil 
Corp" challenge allows participants to showcase their technical skills in a
competitive environment. It helps assess participants' proficiency in reverse 
engineering, exploit development, and vulnerability analysis. Competing in such 
challenges can enhance participants' knowledge and practical skills in
cybersecurity.

Key Components:
The challenge incorporates essential elements, including a snippet of assembly 
code containing various security vulnerabilities, a target system with specific
functionalities and flags to retrieve, exploitation techniques such as stack 
smashing and return-oriented programming (ROP), and a scoring mechanism that 
rewards participants based on the complexity of the vulnerabilities exploited.
Types of Methodologies:
Common exploitation techniques in pwn challenges include buffer overflows, 
format string vulnerabilities, and use-after-free exploits. Participants may need to 
write or modify exploit code to gain control over the target system. Understanding 
memory management, assembly language, and debugging techniques are
essential for success.

Expected Outcomes:
The supposed outcomes this project will be a flag which is basically an exploited 
vulnerability in the code. By doing implementing various techniques. 

Implementation:
This project will first start with scanning for vulnerabilities in the given code. We 
can find the vulnerabilities by various techniques like using Nessus scanning 
techniques, Ghidra, burp suite etc.
After finding the vulnerability will be creating an exploitation code to start the 
exploitation process of exploitation against the given code. After running the 
code, we will be receiving a flag if the exploitation process is success. In our case 
we didnâ€™t able to get the flag, which means we are not successfully able complete 
the challenge.

Conclusion:
The "Evil Corp" challenge offered us the opportunity to enhance our skills in
reverse engineering, vulnerability assessment, and exploitation techniques. It 
served as a practical application of assembly code analysis, a fundamental skill for
cybersecurity professionals. Additionally, the challenge promoted healthy 
competition and encouraged us to think creatively to solve complex security 
problems
